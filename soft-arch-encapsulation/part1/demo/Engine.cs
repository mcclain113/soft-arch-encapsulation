/*
 * Here's a simple example of property encapsulation -- hiding data and,
 * potentially behavior, by making instance properties private and by choosing
 * getter/setter methods appropriately.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - no direct access to property values outside of this class
 * (protects against illegal or inappropriate values being assigned or accessed.)
 * - combine with public get and/or set methods for controlled access
 * (setters control values via validation).
 *
 * Note that we can choose to provide getters AND setters for read/write access,
 * or just getters for read-only access. Or, we could make the class immutable by
 * providing a constructor that initializes all properties and eliminating all
 * public setter methods. This class looks immutable, but it's not because the
 * Start() method mutates the state of the running property.
 *
 * Also notice that this class has a Single Responsibility: to do what an
 * Engine can do and nothing more.
